\#lan #entry
Many folders have manual entry ids which are incremented in t he `_nextId` note.

Tags may include:

* owner, status (pending, active, done, archived, blocked, later, next (where next means there are preceding tasks to finish yet)), task no LTxxx/goal no LGxxx/entry no LExxx/article entry LAxxx, optionally it is linked to other items such as goals via LGxxx

The folders include:

* tasks: objectives to complete.
* goals: concepts to achieve. Unlike goals, these are broad, they could be a tool's concept definition, or a project's concept definition such as disassemble a new battle network. It is high level and had similar tags to tasks.
* entries: These are notes written but not tied to any particular objective to complete. This note is an example. It just explains the schema used here.
* articles: Reader-facing. They could aim to explain a process or tutorial to an audience.

On the task structure

* All tasks are related via links. There are no hierarchies in the folder structure. It's a flat list. Tasks may subtask via a link relation, or they may precede via a sequential relation, or relate to other tasks in any other way.
