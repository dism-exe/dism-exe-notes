First, what color is the icon? And what's the name below it? Can you list each menu and what it reads?

### Objective: To read/write/watch on struct at some address

To define the struct within GDB if it's not already known, use the define` command:

```gdb
define MyStruct
struct MyStruct {
  uint32_t field1;
  uint16_t field2;
  uint8_t  field3;
  uint8_t  field4;
};
end
```
 
 **Print the struct's contents:**

```gdb
p *(struct MyStruct*)my_struct_address
```

*   **Watchpoint on a field:**

    ```gdb
    watch my_struct_instance->field_1
    ```

    This will trigger when the value of field_1` changes.


```gdb
# Read
p/x my_struct_instance->field_1

# Write
set (my_struct_instance->field_1) = <new_value>
```

`p ((MyStruct *)0x20000000)->field1`
`set ((MyStruct *)0x20000000)->field1 = 0x1234`
`watch ((MyStruct *)0x20000000)->field1`
`watch *((char *)0x20000000) // single byte watch`
`*((MyStruct *)0x20000000) // full struct`

You can also use `rwatch` or `awatch` for read-only or access (read/write) watchpoints:
`rwatch ((MyStruct *)0x20000000)->field1`
`awatch ((MyStruct *)0x20000000)->field1`

### Objective: Allow gdb to recognize certain memory ranges to belong to structs

```C
typedef struct {
    uint32_t field1;
    uint16_t field2;
    uint8_t  field3;
    uint8_t  field4;
} MyStruct;

volatile MyStruct MyStructInstance __attribute__((section(".mystruct")));
```

```C
`.mystruct 0x02000000 : { KEEP(*(.mystruct)) } > EWRAM`
```



<hr class="__chatgpt_plugin">

p (*struct MyStruct*) 0x2000000
A syntax error in expression, near `struct MyStruct*) 0x2000000'.


<hr class="__chatgpt_plugin">

Distilled

```
p *(struct MyStruct *)0x2000000
```


<hr class="__chatgpt_plugin">

### role::user

So why does it not recognize that 0x2000000 should be of type struct MyStruct?

I have already added

```C
struct MyStruct {
    uint16_t HP;
    uint16_t MP;
};
volatile struct MyStruct St1 __attribute__((section(".mystruct")));
```

```ldscript
    .mystruct 0x2000000 : { KEEP(*(.mystruct)) } > EWRAM
```

Based on LLM Feedback, here are queries:

```
$ arm-none-eabi-nm -n first.elf | grep St1
02000000 D St1
```

```
(gdb) p *(struct MyStruct *)0x2000000
$2 = {
  HP = 0,
  MP = 0
}
```

<hr class="__chatgpt_plugin">
### role::assistant<span style="font-size: small;"> (chatgpt)</span>

Distilled

```
p St1
```

```
info symbol 0x2000000
```


<hr class="__chatgpt_plugin">
### role::user

Conclusion,

"St1" had to be referenced directly. This should be named in a friendly manner. Gdb recognizes via `info symbol` that `0x2000000` maps to the .mystruct section:

```
>>> p St1
$1 = {
  HP = 0,
  MP = 0
}
>>> info symbol 0x2000000
St1 in section .mystruct
```

In main, I want to set r4 to 0x2000000 specifically. I want to observe how gdb identifies this pointer. Give the `__asm__` C code to add. `ldr r4, =#0x2000000` or similar.

Show me how to write/read/watch from a memory address and some size in general in gdb.

<hr class="__chatgpt_plugin">

### role::assistant<span style="font-size: small;"> (chatgpt)</span>

Distilled

```gdb
x/Nb ADDRESS     # Read N bytes
x/Nh ADDRESS     # Read N halfwords (16-bit)
x/Nw ADDRESS     # Read N words (32-bit)

x/16bx 0x2000000     # Read 16 bytes in hex
x/8hw  0x2000000     # Read 8 halfwords in hex
```

```gdb
`set {uint16_t}0x2000000 = 1234`
`set ((struct MyStruct *)0x2000000)->HP = 99`
`set {int[4]}0x20000000 = {1, 2, 3, 4}`

```
`watch *((TYPE *)ADDRESS)`
`watch *((uint16_t *)0x2000000)`
watch *((char [8]*)0x2000000)   # Watch 8-byte block
`rwatch *((uint16_t *)0x2000000) # Triggers on read`
awatch *((uint16_t *)0x2000000)   # Triggers on read/write

### role::user

I am able to write and read to a struct, but I would like to view its values in hex:

```
$ -exec p St1

$6 = {HP = 3, MP = 17}
```

That should be 0x11, not 17.


<hr class="__chatgpt_plugin">

### role::assistant<span style="font-size: small;"> (gemma3:27b-it-qat)</span>

```gdb
p/x St1
```

This instructs gdb` to print the value of `St1` in hexadecimal format.  The `/x` modifier forces hexadecimal output.  If you're viewing individual members, you can apply the same modifier:

```gdb
p/x St1->HP
```

### role::user

I want to able to merge two build processes: One will generate an elf (full.elf), I do not want to change the symbols on that elf nor intervene in its build process. What I want is this:

I want to create a new project, as I have now, and inject all structs in it accordingly in the c file and ldscript, this will generate an elf, call it toy.elf. I want to merge the two elf files: full.elf and toy.elf such that it retains symbols of both. For toy.elf, keep only type information. I do not care to merge anything else besides the types defined.

Edit:
- Do not give me .o file output. I need to have a final elf.

mGBA cannot open the merged.elf file. 

(Attempt 4)

Recommends to load symbols instead via gdb and not merge elf files:

```sh
$ arm-none-eabi-objcopy --only-keep-debug first.elf firstdbg.elf
$ add-symbol-file firstdbg.elf 0
