In vim, we have `languageserver.ccls` installed as per `CocList > services`. We did `CocUpdate`.

But we get

````
coc.nvim] Server languageserver.ccls failed to start: Error: Launching server "languageserver.ccls" using command ccls failed.
````

As per [stackexchange post](https://vi.stackexchange.com/questions/36929/getting-server-languageserver-ccls-failed-to-start-error-when-ever-i-open-cpp),

````sh
sudo apt-get install ccls
````

Now it says it's running.

The project we're in is on ARM assembly though.

You can find the list of some supported language servers here: [coc.nvim wiki Language-servers](https://github-wiki-see.page/m/neoclide/coc.nvim/wiki/Language-servers). There's nother list in [coc.nvim Using coc extensions](https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim/wiki/Using-coc-extensions).

There is a language server in [lib.rs asm-lsp](https://lib.rs/crates/asm-lsp) ([gh](https://github.com/bergercookie/asm-lsp)).

````sh
cargo install --git https://github.com/bergercookie/asm-lsp asm-lsp
````

Adding to `~/.vim/coc-settings.json`,

````json
"asm-lsp": {
    "command": "asm-lsp",
    "filetypes": [
        "asm", "s", "S"
    ]
}
````

but we're still not able to install it with `:CocInstall asm-lsp`

````
- âœ— asm-lsp Bad response from https://registry.npmjs.org/asm-lsp: 404 
````

In [bergercookie/asm-lsp #254](https://github.com/bergercookie/asm-lsp/issues/254), issue author was able to install it with coc.nvim.

Updating with `:PlugUpdate` and `:PlugUpgrade`.

We could at least use ctags to move around:

````sh
sudo apt-get install exuberant-ctags
ctags -R *
````
