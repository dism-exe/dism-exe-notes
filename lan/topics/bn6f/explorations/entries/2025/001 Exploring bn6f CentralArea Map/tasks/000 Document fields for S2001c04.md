We started in `sub_8005C04` for map warp logic when we noticed that this struct's fields are not all documented. 

But we should be able to search for `oToolkit_S2001c04_Ptr` to find where it is used.

Blocked.

This should be done structurally rather than manually, but we need to get our analysis tools back online.
