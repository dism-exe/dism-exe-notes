# 1 Objective

We have a modding project at [gh LanHikari22/bn6f-modding](https://github.com/LanHikari22/bn6f-modding). We haven't touched it in a long time. At the current version it is, it might still accomplish its objective, so we can check.

* [x] Modding now works

~~We want to take a different approach for the time being. Instead of forking [gh dism-exe/bn6f](https://github.com/dism-exe/bn6f) and having to update often, we take the repository as a dependency and we create a merged game where a C program can run on update, or the main loop of bn6f. This miht help us with the fact that we cannot shift the ROM yet.~~

~~If we achieve this with C, then we can try to also create a rust project to be run instead.~~

* [ ] Get C modding back on
* [ ] Get Rust modding in

We should archive the master branch for [gh LanHikari22/bn6f-modding](https://github.com/LanHikari22/bn6f-modding). Call it `bn6f-mod-2018`. We can play around with it and modify it in `bn6f-mod-2018-1`.

This is a first effort, but we can plan further action.
