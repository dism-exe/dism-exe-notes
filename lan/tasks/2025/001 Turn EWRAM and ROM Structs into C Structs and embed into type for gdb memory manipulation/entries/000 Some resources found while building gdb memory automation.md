While looking into [[#5.2 Specify multiple optional dependencies with different names to be used by features in Cargo.toml for rust]],

I found this [users.rust-lang.org question](https://users.rust-lang.org/t/conditionally-compiling-code-if-a-dependency-exists/5060/10) which explores the possibility that the dependency tree of cargo can be searched for conditional compilation. User suggested a feature for this directly, but It doesn't seem to have been answered.
