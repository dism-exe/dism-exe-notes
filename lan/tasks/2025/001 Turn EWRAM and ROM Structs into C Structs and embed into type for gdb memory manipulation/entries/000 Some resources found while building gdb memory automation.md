While looking into [5.2 Specify multiple optional dependencies with different names to be used by features in Cargo.toml for rust](000%20Some%20resources%20found%20while%20building%20gdb%20memory%20automation.md#52-specify-multiple-optional-dependencies-with-different-names-to-be-used-by-features-in-cargotoml-for-rust),

I found this [users.rust-lang.org question](https://users.rust-lang.org/t/conditionally-compiling-code-if-a-dependency-exists/5060/10) which explores the possibility that the dependency tree of cargo can be searched for conditional compilation. User suggested a feature for this directly, but It doesn't seem to have been answered.
