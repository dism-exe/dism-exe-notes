We should be able to make a tool to extract all types from the repository, and inject them whether they are EWRAM or ROM structs via

````C
// in main.c
struct MyStruct {
    uint16_t HP;
    uint16_t MP;
};
volatile struct MyStruct St1 __attribute__((section(".mystruct")));

struct MyROMStruct {
    uint16_t HP;
    uint16_t MP;
};
volatile struct MyROMStruct St2 __attribute__((section(".myromstruct")));

// in gba_cart.ld

/* EWRAM Struct Info */
.mystruct 0x2000000 : { KEEP(*(.mystruct)) } > EWRAM

/* ROM Struct Info */
.myromstruct 0x8003000 : { KEEP(*(.myromstruct)) } > ROM
}
````

and once we build the elf, we can just retain the debug symbols to be included in gdb:

````
$ arm-none-eabi-objcopy --only-keep-debug first.elf firstdbg.elf
$ (gdb) add-symbol-file firstgdb.elf 0
````

To quickly load the extra symbols and also connect to remote gdb (in the terminal) you can use

````sh
arm-none-eabi-gdb bn6f.elf -ex "target remote localhost:2345" -ex "add-symbol-file firstdbg.elf 0"
````
